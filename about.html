            <h2>THE FOUNDER</h2>
            <h3>Manny B. Villar, Chairman</h3>
            <p>Camella was founded by Manuel B. Villar, Jr. in August 1977. Villar took out a seven-year loan from a rural bank offering low interest rates then kick-started building and selling at his first project, Camella Homes Phase 1 and 2 in Las Piñas, with 160 units initially. The company became the pioneer for developing house and lot packages in the country when the usual practice at that time was to sell lots for future homeowners to build on.</p>
